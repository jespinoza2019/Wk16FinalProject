      <h2>Measuring Liquid vs. Dry Ingredients</h2>
       We’re all about multitaskers when it comes to essential kitchen tools. But, for measuring ingredients, you’ll want to have two sets of measuring tools: one for measuring liquids and another for dry ingredients. Yes, there really is a different between liquid and dry measurements!
      <h2>Liquid Measuring Tools</h2>

        Liquid measuring cups are ideal for measuring liquid ingredients like milk, water, oil, honey, molasses and corn syrup. They’re made from clear glass or plastic, and they usually have a handle and a pouring spout. You’ll find them in 1-cup, 2-cup, 4-cup or 8-cup sizes. It’s helpful to have several sizes, like this 3-piece set.

        To measure liquid ingredients, place the cup on a flat service. If you’re working with a sticky ingredient like honey, spray the cup with cooking spray before adding the ingredient. Then, pour the ingredient as you view the measurement at eye level. Looking at the cup from above can cause inaccurate measurement (unless your measuring cup is designed for viewing above). When you’re finished, use a rubber spatula to remove the contents from the cup.
      <h2>Dry Measuring Tools</h2>

        For measuring dry ingredients or ingredients that mound, like brown sugar, flour, nuts, chocolate chips, sour cream and shortening, you’ll want a set of measuring cups. Made from metal or plastic, these cups have a straight, even rim that makes it easy to level off ingredients with the back of a knife. You’ll want a set with 1/4 cup, 1/3 cup, 1/2 cup and 1 cup. If the set has extra measurements (like 1/8 cup, 2/3 cup or 3/4 cup), consider it a bonus.

        To measure dry ingredients, scoop or spoon the ingredient into the cup. Allow the ingredient to mound a little, positioning the cup over the canister if needed. Then, level the top by sweeping a straight-edged spatula or back of a knife across the rim of the cup.

        For brown sugar, make sure you pay attention to the recipe. If it calls for a “packed” cup, press the brown sugar into the cup with the back of the spoon before leveling the top.
      <h2>Measuring Tools for Small Quantities</h2>

        Finally, to round out your measuring tools, pick up a set of measuring spoons. Measuring spoons have straight, even rims (just like measuring cups) but they can be used to measure both liquid and dry ingredients. Most sets come with 1/4 teaspoon, 1/2 teaspoon, 1 teaspoon, and 1 tablespoon spoons. You may find one that also contains 1/8 teaspoon, 3/4 teaspoon or 1/2 tablespoon measurements.

        To measure dry ingredients with measuring spoons, allow the ingredient to mound before leveling out the top. For liquid ingredients, pour just enough liquid to reach the rim of the spoon. A quick coating of cooking spray will help sticky ingredients like honey from sticking to the spoon.</Card.Body>
